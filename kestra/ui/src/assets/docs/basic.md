### Flow properties

Kestra lets you define and automate flows using simple YAML syntax. Each flow requires an `id`, `namespace`, and `tasks`. Other fields like `triggers`, `labels`, `inputs`, and more are optional.

| Property                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                         | The [flow identifier](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/flow) which represents the name of the flow. This ID must be unique within a namespace and is immutable (you cannot rename the flow ID later, but you can recreate it with a new name).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `namespace`                  | Each flow lives in one [namespace](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/namespace). Namespaces are used to group flows and provide structure. Some concepts in Kestra, such as [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/namespace-files) or [KV Store](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/kv-store) are tied to a namespace.  You cannot change a flow’s namespace after creation; create a new flow with the desired namespace and delete the old one.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `tasks`                      | The list of [tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/tasks) to be executed. Tasks are atomic actions in your flows. By default, they will run sequentially one after the other. However, you can use additional [Flowable tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/tutorial/flowable) to run some tasks in parallel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `inputs`                     | The list of strongly-typed [inputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/inputs) that allow you to make your flows more dynamic and reusable. Instead of hardcoding values in your flow, you can use inputs to run multiple Executions of your flow with different values determined at runtime. Use the syntax `{{ inputs.your_input_name }}` to access specific input values in your tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `outputs`                    | Each flow can [produce outputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/outputs) that can be consumed by other flows. This is a list property, so that your flow can produce as many [outputs](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/outputs) as you need. Each output needs to have an `id` (the name of the output), a `type` (the same types you know from `inputs` e.g. `STRING`, `URI` or `JSON`) and `value` which is the actual output value that will be stored in internal storage and passed to other flows when needed.                                             |
| `labels`                     | Key-value pairs that you can use to organize your flows based on your project, maintainers, or any other criteria. You can use [labels](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/labels) to filter Executions in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `description`                | The [description](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/descriptions) of the flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `checks`                | [`checks`](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/checks) are flow-level assertions evaluated when validating inputs and before creating a new execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `variables`                  | The list of [variables](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/variables) (such as API endpoints, table names, download URLs, etc.) that you can access within tasks using the syntax `{{ vars.your_variable_name }}`. Variables help reuse some values across tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `sla`                     | The list of [SLA conditions](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/sla) specifying an execution `behavior` if the workflow doesn't satisfy the assertion defined in the SLA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `errors`                     | The list of [error tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/errors) that will run if there is an error in the current execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `finally`                    | The list of [finally tasks](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/finally) that will run after the workflow is complete. These tasks will run regardless of whether the workflow was successful or not.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `afterExecution`             | The list of [afterExecution](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/afterexecution) tasks that will run after the execution finishes, regardless of the final state. These tasks will run after execution of the workflow reaches a final state, including the execution of the tasks from the `finally` block.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `disabled`                   | Set it to `true` to temporarily [disable](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/disabled) any new executions of the flow. This is useful when you want to stop a flow from running (even manually) without deleting it. Once you set this property to true, nobody will be able to create any execution of that flow, whether from the UI or via an API call, until the flow is re-enabled by setting this property back to `false` (default behavior) or by deleting this property.                                                                                              |
| `revision`                   | The [flow version](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/revision), managed internally by Kestra, and incremented upon each modification. You should **not** manually set it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `triggers`                   | The list of [triggers](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/triggers) which automatically start a flow execution based on events, such as a scheduled date, a new file arrival, a new message in a queue, or the completion event of another flow's execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `pluginDefaults`               | The list of [default values](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/plugin-defaults), allowing you to avoid repeating the same plugin properties. Using `values`, you can set the default properties. The `type` is a full qualified Java class name, e.g. `io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log`, but you can use a prefix e.g. `io.kestra` to apply some properties to all tasks. If `forced` is set to `true`, the `pluginDefault` will take precedence over properties defined in the task (the default behavior is `forced: false`).                                                                                  |
| `concurrency`                | Control the number of [concurrent executions](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/concurrency) of a given flow by setting the `limit` key. Executions beyond that limit will be queued by default — you can customize that by configuring the `behavior` property which can be set to `QUEUE` (default), `CANCEL` or `FAIL`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `retry`                    | Set a flow-level `retry` policy to restart the execution if any task fails. The retry `behavior` is customizable — you can choose to `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` or `RETRY_FAILED_TASK` (default). Only with the `CREATE_NEW_EXECUTION` behavior, the `attempt` of the execution is incremented. Otherwise, only the failed task run is restarted (incrementing the attempt of the task run rather than the execution). Apart from the `behavior` property, the `retry` policy is identical to [task retries](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/retries). |

### Plugin documentation

To inspect properties of a **specific plugin**, click anywhere in that task, trigger or plugin code within the editor. The task documentation will load in this view.

### Task properties

Each flow consists of **tasks**. The following core properties are available to all tasks.

| `logToFile`     | A boolean that lets you store logs as a file in internal storage. That file can be previewed and downloaded from the Logs and Gantt Execution tabs. When set to `true`, logs aren’t saved in the database, which is useful for tasks that produce a large amount of logs that would otherwise take up too much space. The same property can be set on triggers. |


### Input types

Inputs in Kestra are strongly typed. Each type defines how values are entered, validated, and rendered in the UI. Below are all supported input types and their validation rules.

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STRING`           | Any string value. Values are passed without parsing. You can add a `validator` regex for custom validation.           |
| `INT`              | Integer without decimals. Supports `min` and `max` validation to enforce numeric ranges. Example: `42`.                                                                                                                                      |
| `FLOAT`            | Floating-point number with decimals. Supports `min` and `max` validation. Example: `3.14`.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `BOOL` | Boolean flag, must be `true` or `false`. Avoid scalar equivalents such as `yes`/`no`, as the API and UI expect `true` or `false`.                                                                                        |
| `SELECT`           | Single value chosen from a predefined list, either static `values` or a dynamic list defined via an `expression`, which can render values using `kv()` or `http()` functions. Supports `allowCustomValue` to let user enter a custom value and `autoSelectFirst` to preselect the first item. |
| `MULTISELECT`      | One or more values chosen from a predefined list, either static `values` or a dynamic list defined via an `expression`, which can render values using `kv()` or `http()` functions. Supports `allowCustomValue` to let user enter a custom value and `autoSelectFirst` to preselect the first item.                                                                                     |
| `DATE`             | ISO-8601 date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Supports `after` and `before` validation to enforce valid ranges. Example: `2042-12-28`.                                                                                                                       |
| `TIME`             | ISO-8601 time (`HH:MM:SS`) without timezone. Supports `after` and `before` validation. Example: `10:15:30`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `DATETIME`         | ISO-8601 datetime with timezone in UTC format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Supports `after` and `before` validation. Example: `2042-04-02T04:20:42.000Z`.                                                                                       |
| `DURATION`         | ISO-8601 duration string, e.g. `PT5M6S`. Supports `min` and `max` duration bounds.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `FILE`             | File upload via `multipart/form-data`. Uploaded files are stored in Kestra’s internal storage and exposed as `kestra:///...` URIs. You can pass Namespace Files as `defaults` using the protocol: `defaults: nsfile:///hello.txt`.                                                                               |
| `JSON`             | Valid JSON string, parsed into a typed object. Example: `{"name": "kestra"}`.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `YAML`             | Valid YAML string, parsed into a typed object. Example: `- user: John`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `URI`              | Valid URI string. Example: `https://kestra.io/docs`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SECRET`           | Encrypted string stored in the database. Decrypted at runtime and masked in UI/execution context. Requires an [encryption key](https://kestra.io/docs/configuration#encryption).                                                                        |
| `ARRAY`            | JSON array or YAML list. Must define `itemType` (e.g., `INT`, `STRING`, `DATETIME`). Each item is validated against its type. Example defaults: `[1, 2, 3]` or YAML list.                                                                    |


### Input properties

All input types share a common set of properties. These define how inputs behave, whether they are required, and how they appear in the UI.

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Unique identifier for the input. Used to access the input at runtime e.g. `{{ inputs.myInput }}`. |
| `type`            | The input type, chosen from the supported list e.g. `STRING`, `INT`, `FLOAT`, etc.                                                                  |
| `required`        | Whether the input must be provided. If `required: true`, the execution must have a value, either provided at runtime or via `defaults`.                                      |
| `defaults`        | Default value to use if no value is provided at runtime. Must match the declared type.                                    |
| `dependsOn`       | Makes this input dependent on an array of `inputs` with optional `condition` to show inputs in the UI only when needed.                                          |
| `displayName`     | Human-readable label for the input in the UI.                                                                                                      |
| `description`     | Markdown description rendered in the UI when executing the flow.                                                                                                           |
| `expression`      | Pebble expression to fetch dynamic values e.g. using `kv()` or `http()` functions. Commonly used with `SELECT` or `MULTISELECT`.                             |
| `autoSelectFirst` | If `true`, auto-selects the first option from a dropdown when no default is set (applies to `SELECT` and `MULTISELECT`).                           |

    description: this is a *task* documentation
    message: |
      The variables we used are {{ vars.first }} and {{ render(vars.second) }}.
      The input is {{ inputs.user }} and the task was started at {{ taskrun.startDate }} from flow {{ flow.id }}.

You can document flows, tasks, inputs, or triggers with the `description` property. These descriptions are rendered in the UI using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

### Pebble templating

Kestra has a [Pebble templating engine](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/pebble) allowing you to dynamically render variables, inputs and outputs within the execution context using [Pebble expressions](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/expression). For example, the `{{ flow.namespace }}` expression allows accessing the namespace of the current flow and the `{{ printContext() }}` function allows you to print the entire context of the execution, which is useful for debugging.

### Pebble functions, filters and tags

| Filter           | Example and Description                                                                                                          |
